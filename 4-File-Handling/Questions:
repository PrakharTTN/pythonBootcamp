Q1. You have a number.txt, with each line a real number. Write a code to split this file into 3 files as follows:

even.txt  -- contain all even numbers
odd.txt -- all odd number
float.txt -- all floating point number

Use with() clause for file handling

Q2. Write a code to read a "Python_script.py" as inpit file and extract following information to prepare a JSON

* all package name which the input Python script use
* all function name which the  input Python script define
* all class name which the  input Python script define
* all the variable name  which the input Python script define

example output:
{
"package": ["os", "itertools"],
"funation": ["function1", "function2"],
"class": ["classA", "classB"],
"variable": ["num", "i", "j"]
}

Q3. Without using Python CSV module write a "csvlook` command

csvlook should have following features:

* [-d DELIMITER]    	if -`d` option not passed script should be able to guess a separator

* [-q QUOTECHAR]   used to parsed colum value parenthesised within QUOTECHAR, if the value not passed should assume default value double quote

`csvlook` should display data nicely on console in uniform width

To project the data `csvlook`  script should accept comma separated  column numbers, e.g

-f 	3,5,7 	should print only column 3, 5 7

--skip-row  N  	to skil first N rows
--head   N        	to display only first N rows
--tail N              	to display last N rows
